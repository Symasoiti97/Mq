# Тестовое задание по вакансии C# developer

Given:<br/>
System A generates messages (simple strings) in random way. That system may generate N messages per second and then be idle for hours. Every message has its own priority.<br/>
System B can process messages in some way, e.g. by sending them to stdout/console. Message processing logic is very slow, it is limited by 1 message/second.<br/>

Problem definition:<br/>
Implement mentioned program logic (systems A and B).<br/>
The implementation of the system A should generate messages. The implementation of the System B should receive generated messages and process them (e.g. send to stdout) with the mentioned performance limitation.<br/>
Processing should be priority based - messages with higher priority must be processed first<br/>
No messages generated by the System A can be lost, all messages should be processed according to their priority<br/>
